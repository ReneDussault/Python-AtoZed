        {
          "id": 1,
          "question": "Which statement is used to exit a loop prematurely?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "continue",
            "b": "break",
            "c": "pass",
            "d": "return"
          },
          "correct_answer": "b",
          "explanation": "The 'break' statement immediately exits the current loop and continues execution after the loop. 'continue' skips to the next iteration, 'pass' does nothing, and 'return' exits a function."
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "question": "What does the continue statement do in a loop?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "Exits the loop",
            "b": "Skips the current iteration",
            "c": "Does nothing",
            "d": "Restarts the loop"
          },
          "correct_answer": "b",
          "explanation": "The 'continue' statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration of the loop. It doesn't exit the loop entirely like 'break' does."
        },
        {
          "id": 3,
          "question": "What will range(1, 5) generate?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "[1, 2, 3, 4]",
            "b": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",
            "c": "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]",
            "d": "[2, 3, 4, 5]"
          },
          "correct_answer": "a",
          "explanation": "range(1, 5) generates numbers from 1 (inclusive) to 5 (exclusive), so it produces 1, 2, 3, 4. The stop value is never included in the range."
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "question": "Which loop is best when you don't know how many iterations you need?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "for loop",
            "b": "while loop",
            "c": "do-while loop",
            "d": "foreach loop"
          },
          "correct_answer": "b",
          "explanation": "A while loop is ideal when the number of iterations depends on a condition that may change during execution. For loops are better when you know the exact number of iterations or are iterating over a collection."
        },
        {
          "id": 5,
          "question": "What is the purpose of try-except blocks?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "To repeat code",
            "b": "To handle errors",
            "c": "To define functions",
            "d": "To create loops"
          },
          "correct_answer": "b",
          "explanation": "Try-except blocks are used for exception handling. Code in the 'try' block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it's caught and handled in the 'except' block, preventing the program from crashing."
        },
        {
          "id": 6,
          "question": "What happens in a for-else loop when the loop completes normally?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "The else block is skipped",
            "b": "The else block executes",
            "c": "An error is raised",
            "d": "The loop restarts"
          },
          "correct_answer": "b",
          "explanation": "In a for-else construct, the else block executes when the loop completes normally (without encountering a break statement). If break is used to exit the loop, the else block is skipped."
        },
        {
          "id": 7,
          "question": "Which function would you use to iterate over both indices and values of a list?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "range()",

            "c": "enumerate()",
            "d": "zip()"
          },
          "correct_answer": "c",
          "explanation": "enumerate() returns pairs of (index, value) for each item in an iterable. This is more Pythonic than using range(len(list)) to get indices manually."
        },
        {
          "id": 8,
          "question": "What does zip() function do with two lists?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "Combines them into one list",
            "b": "Pairs corresponding elements",
            "c": "Sorts both lists",
            "d": "Finds common elements"
          },
          "correct_answer": "b",
          "explanation": "zip() pairs corresponding elements from multiple iterables. For example, zip([1,2], ['a','b']) produces (1,'a'), (2,'b'). It stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted."
        },
        {
          "id": 9,
          "question": "Which exception would you catch for invalid user input when converting to int?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "ValueError",
            "b": "TypeError",
            "c": "IndexError",
            "d": "KeyError"
          },
          "correct_answer": "a",
          "explanation": "ValueError is raised when int() receives a string that cannot be converted to an integer (like 'abc'). TypeError occurs with wrong data types, IndexError with invalid list indices, and KeyError with missing dictionary keys."
        },
        {
          "id": 10,
          "question": "What's the difference between range(5) and range(1, 5)?",
          "code": null,
          "options": {
            "a": "No difference",
            "b": "First includes 0, second starts from 1",
            "c": "First generates 5 numbers, second generates 4",
            "d": "Both b and c"
          },
          "correct_answer": "d",
          "explanation": "range(5) generates [0,1,2,3,4] (5 numbers starting from 0), while range(1,5) generates [1,2,3,4] (4 numbers starting from 1). So the first includes 0 and generates more numbers."
        },
        {
          "id": 11,
          "question": "What does the pass statement do?",

            "a": "Skips the current iteration",
            "b": "Exits the loop",

            "d": "Raises an exception"
          },
          "correct_answer": "c",
          "explanation": "The 'pass' statement is a null operation - it does nothing when executed. It's used as a placeholder where Python syntax requires a statement but no action is needed, like in empty function definitions or incomplete code."

          },
          "correct_answer": "b",
          "explanation": "The loop iterates i=0,1,2. When i=1, continue skips the print statement and goes to the next iteration. So only 0 and 2 are printed."

          "correct_answer": "a",
          "explanation": "x starts at 0. The loop prints x then increments it. When x becomes 3, the condition x < 3 is false, so the loop stops. Output: 0, 1, 2."
