    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following correctly imports the entire math module?",
      "options": [
        "include math",
        "import math",
        "from math import *",
        "Both b and c"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Both 'import math' and 'from math import *' import the entire math module. However, 'import math' is generally preferred as it avoids namespace pollution and potential naming conflicts."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is the correct way to import only the sqrt function from the math module?",
      "options": [
        "import math.sqrt",
        "from math import sqrt",
        "import sqrt from math",
        "include sqrt"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The syntax 'from math import sqrt' imports only the sqrt function from the math module, allowing you to use it directly as sqrt() without the math prefix."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which file must be present in a directory to make it a Python package?",
      "options": [
        "package.py",
        "__init__.py",
        "module.py",
        "index.py"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The __init__.py file marks a directory as a Python package. It can be empty or contain initialization code for the package."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "How do you import the random module with an alias 'rnd'?",
      "options": [
        "import random as rnd",
        "from random import rnd",
        "import random = rnd",
        "alias random as rnd"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The syntax 'import random as rnd' imports the random module and gives it the alias 'rnd', allowing you to use rnd.function() instead of random.function()."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What will this code output?\n```python\nimport math\nprint(math.pi)\n```",
      "options": [
        "3.14",
        "3.141592653589793",
        "pi",
        "Error"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "math.pi returns the mathematical constant pi as a float with full precision: 3.141592653589793."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What does this code do?\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nnow = datetime.now()\n```",
      "options": [
        "Creates a datetime object with current time",
        "Prints current time",
        "Imports the time",
        "Error"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "This code imports the datetime class from the datetime module and creates a datetime object containing the current date and time, stored in the variable 'now'."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "If you have a module my_module.py with a function hello(), how do you call it after 'import my_module'?",
      "options": [
        "hello()",
        "my_module.hello()",
        "my_module->hello()",
        "call my_module.hello()"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "After importing with 'import my_module', you access functions using dot notation: my_module.hello(). The module name acts as a namespace."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the purpose of 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":' in a module?",
      "options": [
        "Define the main function",
        "Code runs only when file is executed directly",
        "Import other modules",
        "Create a class"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":' block ensures code runs only when the file is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module. __name__ equals \"__main__\" only for the main script."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which standard library module is used for generating random numbers?",
      "options": [
        "math",
        "random",
        "numbers",
        "generate"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'random' module provides functions for generating random numbers, including randint(), choice(), shuffle(), and random()."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What will this code output?\n```python\nfrom math import sqrt\nprint(sqrt(25))\n```",

        "os",
        "system",
        "platform"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'os' module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as os.getcwd() for getting the current working directory and os.listdir() for listing directory contents."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What does 'from math import *' do?",
      "options": [
        "Imports only the math constants",
        "Imports all functions and constants from math",
        "Creates a math variable",
        "Imports the math module with an alias"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The '*' wildcard imports all public functions and constants from the math module into the current namespace, allowing direct use without the math prefix. However, this is generally not recommended as it can cause naming conflicts."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which module is used for working with dates and times in Python?",
      "options": [

        "calendar",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Python has multiple modules for working with dates and times: 'datetime' for date/time objects, 'time' for time-related functions, and 'calendar' for calendar-related operations."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "What will this code output?\n```python\nimport random\nprint(type(random.randint(1, 10)))\n```",
      "options": [
        "<class 'float'>",
        "<class 'int'>",
        "<class 'random'>",
        "<class 'number'>"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "random.randint() returns a random integer within the specified range, so type() will return <class 'int'>."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "How do you access the command-line arguments in a Python script?",
      "options": [
        "sys.args",
        "sys.argv",
        "os.args",
        "args.sys"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Command-line arguments are accessible through sys.argv, which is a list where sys.argv[0] is the script name and sys.argv[1:] contains the arguments."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is the difference between a module and a package in Python?",
      "options": [
        "No difference, they are the same",
        "A module is a file, a package is a directory containing modules",
        "A package is a file, a module is a directory",
        "Modules are built-in, packages are custom"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A module is a single Python file (.py), while a package is a directory containing multiple modules and an __init__.py file that makes it importable."

      "question": "Which function from the time module can be used to measure execution time?",
      "options": [
        "time.sleep()",
        "time.time()",
        "time.clock()",
        "time.measure()"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "time.time() returns the current time in seconds since the epoch. You can use it before and after code execution and subtract to measure elapsed time."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "What will this code output?\n```python\nimport sys\nprint(len(sys.argv))\n# Assume script is run as: python script.py arg1 arg2\n```",
      "options": [
        "2",
        "3",
        "4",
        "1"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "sys.argv contains ['script.py', 'arg1', 'arg2'], so len(sys.argv) returns 3. sys.argv[0] is always the script name."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "How do you import multiple specific functions from a module?",
      "options": [
        "from math import sqrt, pi, cos",
        "import math.sqrt, math.pi, math.cos",
        "from math import (sqrt, pi, cos)",
        "Both a and c"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Both 'from math import sqrt, pi, cos' and 'from math import (sqrt, pi, cos)' are correct. The parentheses version is useful for longer import lists."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What happens when you import a module that contains executable code outside of functions?",
      "options": [
        "The code is ignored",
        "The code runs immediately when imported",
        "The code runs only when called",
        "An error occurs"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "When a module is imported, all code at the module level (outside functions/classes) executes immediately. This is why 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":' is used to prevent certain code from running during import."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Which module would you use to create temporary files?",
      "options": [
        "os",

        "tempfile",
        "io"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The 'tempfile' module provides functions for creating temporary files and directories, such as tempfile.TemporaryFile() and tempfile.mkdtemp()."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "What will this code do?\n```python\nimport os\nprint(os.getcwd())\n```",

        "Print the user's home directory"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "os.getcwd() returns the current working directory as a string, which is then printed."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "How do you check if a module is being run directly or imported?",
      "options": [
        "Check if __file__ exists",
        "Check if __name__ == '__main__'",
        "Check if sys.argv[0] exists",
        "Check if __import__ is True"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "You check 'if __name__ == '__main__':' to determine if a module is being run directly. When imported, __name__ equals the module name; when run directly, it equals '__main__'."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "What is the purpose of the sys module?",
      "options": [
        "System administration tasks",

    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "What will this code output?\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\ntoday = date.today()\nprint(type(today))\n```",
      "options": [
        "<class 'str'>",
        "<class 'datetime.date'>",
        "<class 'date'>",
        "<class 'datetime.datetime'>"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "date.today() returns a date object, so type() returns <class 'datetime.date'>. The full module path is shown in the type representation."
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "Which statement about Python packages is correct?",
      "options": [
        "__init__.py must contain code",
        "__init__.py can be empty",
        "Packages cannot contain other packages",
        "Package names must be uppercase"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "__init__.py can be completely empty - its presence alone marks the directory as a package. It can also contain initialization code that runs when the package is imported."
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "What is the recommended way to import modules to avoid naming conflicts?",
      "options": [
        "Always use 'from module import *'",
        "Use 'import module' and access with module.function()",
        "Always use aliases",
        "Import only built-in modules"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Using 'import module' and accessing functions with 'module.function()' is generally recommended as it keeps the namespace clean and makes it clear which module each function comes from."
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "What will this code output?\n```python\nimport math as m\nfrom random import randint\nprint(type(m.pi))\nprint(type(randint))\n```",
      "options": [
        "<class 'float'>, <class 'int'>",
        "<class 'float'>, <class 'function'>",
        "<class 'math'>, <class 'random'>",
        "Error"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "m.pi is a float constant (mathematical pi), and randint is a function object. So the output is <class 'float'>, <class 'function'>."
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "question": "In a custom module, what happens to variables defined at module level?",
      "options": [
        "They are private and cannot be accessed",
        "They become module attributes accessible via dot notation",
        "They are automatically deleted after import",
        "They only exist during import"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Variables defined at module level become module attributes and can be accessed using dot notation (e.g., my_module.my_variable) after importing the module."
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Consider this package structure:\n```\nmy_package/\n├── __init__.py\n├── module1.py\n└── module2.py\n```\nHow do you import a function 'hello' from module1?",

        "from my_package import hello"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct syntax is 'from my_package.module1 import hello'. This imports the hello function from module1 within the my_package package using dot notation to specify the path."
