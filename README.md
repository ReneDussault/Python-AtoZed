### Installation Steps
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ReneDussault/python-AtoZed.git
   cd python-AtoZed
   ```

2. **Install VS Code extensions:**
   These steps should be done inside VScode, but I'll provide links to the extensions to get you started.
   - [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

   - File > Open Folder > `python-AtoZed`
   - Open/expand the `theory` folder and open the `python-atozed.ipynb` file (double click)
   - Select your Python interpreter when prompted (after running a code cell)

4. **Start learning:**
   - Run code cells with `Ctrl+Enter` (keeps current cell selected) or `Shift+Enter` (moves to next cell)
   - Follow the course from start to finish or jump to specific topics using the table of contents

5. **Test your knowledge:**
   - Navigate to the `quizzes` folder
   - Run `python interactive_quiz.py` to access the quiz system
   - Choose from section-specific quizzes or take the comprehensive final exam

> **Note**: You can use any IDE that supports Python and Jupyter notebooks!
