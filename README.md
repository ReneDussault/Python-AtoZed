# Python - A to Zed

## Complete Introduction to Python Programming

Welcome to **Python-AtoZed**!  
This comprehensive course takes you from Python basics to advanced concepts like Object-Oriented Programming, modules, and decorators.  
Whether you're a complete beginner or coming from another programming language, this course provides hands-on learning with practical examples and exercises.

### What You'll Learn
- **Solid Foundation**: Python syntax, data types, and core concepts
- **Data Structures**: Work with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- **Control Flow**: Understand conditionals, loops, and program logic
- **Functions**: Write reusable code with functions and lambda expressions
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- **Modules & Libraries**: Organize code and use Python's extensive ecosystem
- **BONUS**: Decorators

### Course Features
- **Beginner Friendly**: Starts with absolute basics
- **Progressive Learning**: Each section builds on previous knowledge
- **Practical Focus**: Every concept includes working code examples
- **Exercises & Summaries**: Reinforce learning with practice problems
- **Interactive**: Designed for Jupyter notebooks with immediate feedback
- **Comprehensive**: Covers everything needed for Python proficiency

## Local Setup (Recommended for Long-term Learning)

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ReneDussault/python-AtoZed.git
   cd python-AtoZed
   ```

2. **Install VS Code extensions:**
   These steps should be done inside VScode, but I'll provide links to the extensions to get you started.
   - [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
   - [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

3. **Open the course:**
   - Launch VS Code
   - File > Open Folder > `python-AtoZed`
   - Open/expand the `theory` folder and open the `python-atozed.ipynb` file (double click)
   - Select your Python interpreter when prompted (after running a code cell)

4. **Start learning:**
   - Run code cells with `Ctrl+Enter` (keeps current cell selected) or `Shift+Enter` (moves to next cell)
   - Follow the course from start to finish or jump to specific topics using the table of contents

> **Note**: You can use any IDE that supports Python and Jupyter notebooks!
