    "- It was developed with the goal of making programming more accessible and efficient while maintaining versatility.  \n",

    "Why choose Python?  \n",
    "- Readability: Its design philosophy emphasizes code clarity.  \n",
    "- Efficiency: Python allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or Java.  \n",
    "- Extensive Library Support: Python's standard library is often described as \"batteries included,\" providing tools for tasks like file handling, networking, and web scraping.  \n",

    "1. Case Sensitivity: Python distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example:\n",

    "    myVariable = 5\n",
    "    myvariable = 10\n",
    "    print(myVariable) # Outputs: 5\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    ``myVariable`` and ``myvariable`` are different variables.  \n",

    "        print(\"Indentation matters!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    ```py\n",
    "    # this is a comment, it will not be executed by the interpreter\n",
