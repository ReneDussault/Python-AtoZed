    "## Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to fundamental Python concepts with practical examples.  \n",
    "It's designed for both beginners and intermediate learners looking to build a solid foundation and strengthen their Python skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.  \n",
    "- It was developed with the goal of making programming more accessible and efficient while maintaining versatility.  \n",
    "- Python is renowned for its readability and wide range of applications, from data science and web development to automation and more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why choose Python?  \n",
    "- Readability: Its design philosophy emphasizes code clarity.  \n",
    "- Efficiency: Python allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or Java.  \n",
    "- Extensive Library Support: Python's standard library is often described as \"batteries included,\" providing tools for tasks like file handling, networking, and web scraping.  \n",
    "- Community Support: With an extensive user base, Python boasts rich resources, forums, and libraries for virtually every domain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts to start with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Case Sensitivity: Python distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    myVariable = 5\n",
    "    myvariable = 10\n",
    "    print(myVariable)  # Outputs: 5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    ``myVariable`` and ``myvariable`` are different variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Indentation: Unlike many other languages that use curly braces {}, Python uses indentation (typically four spaces, refer to pep8) to define code blocks.  \n",
    "Consistent indentation is mandatory for proper code execution:\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    if True:\n",
    "        print(\"Indentation matters!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will review most of this in the Basic Syntax section, which is next.  \n",
    "So, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "To see Python in action, run the following code snippet:"
